# Welcome to biobankly! üå±

Hello and welcome to **biobankly**! I'm **chonkie**, and I'm here to help scientists, students, and small companies navigate the UK Biobank's transition to DNANexus cloud computing.

## Featured Repositories ‚ú®

### 1. [UKB-Phenotype-Explorer üëÄ](https://github.com/biobankly/ukb-ontology)

**What It Does:**  
This is your go-to tool for exploring UK Biobank showcase data with ease! Navigate through categories, select and download phenotype `field_ids`, and generate a ready-to-go phenotype CSV file. Perfect for seamless importing into the Swiss Army Knife tool, and ultimately simplifying data processing in the RAP.

*Each repository includes a [LICENCE.md](https://github.com/biobankly/ukb-ontology/blob/main/LICENCE.md) file.*

### 2. [UKB-Extractor üèóÔ∏è](https://github.com/biobankly/ukb-extract)

**What It Does:**  
A powerful companion to the UKB-Phenotype-Explorer, the UKB-Extractor efficiently fetches the phenotype data you've selected. Together, these two repos form a pipeline that takes you from discovery to extraction, ensuring your data is always at your fingertips.

**They work hand in hand!**  
Using the **UKB-Phenotype-Explorer**, you pick your data, and with the **UKB-Extractor**, you turn that selection into a tangible CSV file, ready to be processed and analyzed.

*Each repository includes a [LICENCE.md](https://github.com/biobankly/ukb-extract/blob/main/LICENCE.md) file.*
