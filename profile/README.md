# Welcome to biobankly!

Hello and welcome to **biobankly**! I'm **chonkie**, and I'm here to help scientists, students, and small companies navigate the UK Biobank's transition to DNANexus cloud computing.

## Summary üìú

Each repository in this organization serves a specific function to help you manage and utilize the UK Biobank Nexus Platform more effectively. Whether you're running models, performing diagnostics, or handling data uploads, you'll find a repository tailored to simplify that particular process.

## About Me :bowtie:

I'm currently a student working on my dissertation focused on the UK Biobank. Throughout my research, I've noticed that the Biobank's resources are scattered across various websites and YouTube videos, making it challenging for beginners to get started‚Äîespecially for those without an in-house developer team.

## New to GitHub? :octocat:

No worries! GitHub is simply a platform to share and collaborate. Here, I'm sharing templates and instructions that you can download, customize, and use without needing advanced GitHub knowledge. If you're new, don't be alarmed‚ÄîI'm here to help you every step of the way.

## What Is GitHub? :octocat:

**GitHub** is a platform where you can access and download code and files online. Think of it as a library where you can find resources to help you with your projects. You don't need to worry about sharing code or collaborating with other developers‚Äîsimply download the templates and instructions you need to get started.

## What Is a Repository? üìÅ

A **repository** (or "repo" for short) is like a folder for your project on GitHub. It contains all the files and folders related to your project, including code, documentation, and any other resources you need. Repositories help you organize your work and make it easy to share with others.

## Navigating the Repositories üó∫Ô∏è

On the left panel you will find all biobankly's repo's.  When you click on a repository, the first thing you'll see is a list of files that make up the repository. These files might look intimidating at first, but don't worry! The most important part for you is to:

1. **Read the README File:** Each repository contains a README file that provides detailed instructions and information about the project.
2. **Bring a Great Attitude and a Smile:** Learning new tools can be challenging, but maintaining a positive mindset helps.
3. **Be Patient:** Sometimes things don't work the first time, but with a bit of patience, we'll get there together.

Each repository is designed to handle a small, specific process within the UK Biobank Nexus Platform, making it easier for you to manage and utilize the resources effectively.
